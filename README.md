# GLMsingle

GLMsingle is a toolbox for obtaining accurate single-trial estimates
in fMRI time-series data. We provide both MATLAB and Python implementations.

GLMsingle can be viewed as a wholesale replacement of its predecessor,
GLMdenoise (http://github.com/kendrickkay/GLMdenoise).

## MATLAB

To use the GLMsingle toolbox, add it to your MATLAB path:
  addpath(genpath('GLMsingle/matlab'));

To try the toolbox on an example dataset, change to the GLMsingle directory 
and then TBD...

## Python
